    "  As everyone unfortunately knows, COVID-19 has brought the world to a standstill and is the worst pandemic in a century. Because of this, the world health community has devoted an unprecedented amount of resources towards the study, containment, and hopefully the eradication of this disease. However, this also means that an unprecedented amount of data has been produced, much more than researchers and journalists can sort through by hand. Thus, this contest was started by Kaggle to help develop new methods of sorting through the massive amount of papers being written on the subject. Our contribution is to make major improvements on the method developed by \"dirktheeng\" in their “Anserini+BERT-SQuAD for Semantic Corpus Search” notebook. The link to their notebook can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/dirktheeng\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology is very similar to the one used in the original notebook. The basic idea is to use the BERT model to perform basic question and answer tasks, i.e. the user can ask the model a question, and it will return what it thinks the best answer is from a database. In the case of the original notebook, this model was used to scan through numerous paper abstracts to find which abstracts best answer the question. To do this, the model would take in a question plus candidate abstract and output a start index, end index, and its confidence value. The start index is where the most relevant part of the text starts, the end index is where it ends, and the confidence value is how sure it is that’s the right answer. The model then does this for the rest of the abstracts, ranks them based on confidence values, and returns the answer it’s most confident of, along with the paper that it comes from. This is a perfectly fine model, however, there were a few key improvements that we were able to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we extended the model to search the entire paper, not just the abstract. The BERT model is only able to handle text shorter than 512 words. When factoring in the length of the question statement, this means that the original model could only handle chunks of text shorter than 500 words. Since abstracts are always shorter than that, the length constraints weren’t an issue for the original model. However, there is a lot of potentially useful information in the body of these papers, so it would better if the model could scan this as well. To do this, we simply broke up longer text into chucks less than 500 words, and ran each smaller chunk through the model separately. Thus, we were able to find which part of the paper was most relevant and return it. Also, this requires much more data than the original model’s database, which only included the abstracts. So, we added in a way to upload the body text, match it to the right abstract, merge the two, and pass the full text on to the model. This allows our improved model to handle much more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there was a major bug in the original model where it could return nonsensical index ranges where the start index came after the end index. For example, if the model returns a range of [26,13], it’s impossible to reconstruct the answer from that. We came up with a rather ingenious solution to this problem. If the model returns a range such as [26,13], our new model fix that by breaking the original text chunk into two parts, say [0,13] and [26,n-1] (n is the length of the original text chunk). Then, it will find two new potential answer ranges, say [7,13] and [26,31], and return the one it’s more confident of. Thus, our new model fixes this bug and is more reliable. \n",
